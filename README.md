## **Description**

I have created an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application will use an express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. View the deployed app here: https://cw-notes-taker.herokuapp.com/.

### **Installation**

This project has dependencies on Express, Path, and FS. You will need to have Node installed and then run `npm install express` to be able to run. To run the program locally, you can either install [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) or just run `node server.js`. After this step, open your browser and navigate to `localhost:3000`. This should display the app.
